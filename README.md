# Bottom-Up-Parser

Bottom-up parsing can be defined as an attempt to reduce the input string w to the start symbol of grammar by tracing out the rightmost derivations of w in reverse. Bottom-up parsing starts from the leaf nodes of a tree and works in upward direction till it reaches the root node. Here, we start from a sentence and then apply production rules in reverse manner in order to reach the start symbol.
